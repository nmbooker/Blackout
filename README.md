# Blackout

Very simple: it's a window of all black.  Maximise it and put it behind the
window you want to focus on so you can read what's in there easier.

I wrote it because I wanted to concentrate on reading the contents of a
specific window, but kept getting distracted by the stuff (like wallpaper
and other windows) in the background.  If I maximised, the document I was reading, my area of attention was too wide and I couldn't keep the document within my field of concentration.

So I wrote this, so I could keep my area of attention narrow while not being
distracted by the stuff going on behind.


## Prerequisites

Requires the packages known on Ubuntu as:

* python-qt4
* pyqt4-dev-tools

## Build and Install

```
git clone git://github.com/nmbooker/Blackout.git
cd Blackout
make
```

## Running

If you have the 'rox' file manager, just double-click the Blackout app directory.

Contributions of artwork for an icon welcome.

If you don't have rox, just run the 'AppRun' script within (or build a
script in your ~/bin or /usr/local/bin that does that for you).
